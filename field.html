<center><h1>Tagaytay Field Trip</h1></center>
<center><article class="story">
<p>This is my first ever field trip in high school. This is also the start of my wanderlust. We went to different places like Intramuros, Manila Ocean Park and Aguinaldo Shrine but my favorite is the horse-back riding in Tagaytay where you can see the beautiful view of the Taal Volcano and its lake and it was also my first time to ride a horse. There is also a bike for rent there that I also tried and that was great! <br><br>We also went to People's Park in the Sky where you can feel the cold breeze of air and sight the beauty of sunset with the Tagaytay view around.<br><br>I also enjoyed tasting foods there (because we also went to a Souvenir and Pasalubong shop). Their mouth-watering buko pie, buko tarts and crispy banana chips that I wish they are available in Malabon but not.</p>
