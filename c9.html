<p>This is my last and best escapade for year 2016. I am with a friend and we went to Cloud9 Antipolo simply because we just want to hang out together and try the hanging bridge there. So fun and new, we really enjoyed the place a lot. We crossed the hanging bridge that I didn't expect it was not easy (because I'm a little bit nervous of heights) and we took selfies and pictures with the 360 degrees overlooking view of Antipolo a LOT. Other than that, the place has also a hotel, restaurant, swimming pool and zipline but unfortunately, we didn't have enough money to try them all.<br><br>We also visited the Christmas Lighthouse inside the Filinvest by 7 o'clock in the evening. The house is full of Christmas lights and decorations, free entrance for everyone, and perfect for picture taking. Having a tour around the house will make you feel like you're in an amusement park 'cause you will be amazed of the lights, the huggable bears and beautiful decorations around.</p>
