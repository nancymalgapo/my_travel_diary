<center><h1>Wawa Dam Adventure</h1></center>
<center><article class="story">
<p>This is my first ever research on field with college classmates. We went there for a required research about folks and myths about Wawa Dam. As a first timer, I enjoyed the place a lot, most especially the big rocks on the rivers, the Mount Pamitinan view that is just one hike away from the place and the unlimited shower on Wawa Dam.<br><br>I also enjoyed talking and listening to stories of some residents there that we interviewed about the mysteries of the place. They told us some horrible stories like Diwata Pandora, the legendary character Bernardo Carpio, and the hiding camp of Japanese warriors inside the Mount Pamitinan.<br><br>All in all, this adventure is one of the most unforgettable experience of my college life, and how I wish I can go back there with friends again. </p>
